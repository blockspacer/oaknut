 * @class Task
 * @brief Any cancelable operation that performs a callback
 * on the main thread when finished, unless the operation was cancelled.
 *
 * NB: Task is *not* an API for scheduling background app work, see `Worker` for that.
 *
 * `Task` is not intended for instantiation in app code, Tasks are
 * typically created and returned by platform APIs. For example
 * `Bitmap::createFromData()` returns a Task representing a background
 * operation that decodes a bitmap from PNG or JPG data.
