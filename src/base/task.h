/**
 Task represents a cancelable operation that performs a callback
 on the main thread when finished (unless cancelled).

 NB: Task is *not* an API for scheduling background app work, see Worker for that.

 Task is not intended for instantiation in app code, they are
 typically created and returned by platform APIs. For example
 Bitmap::createFromData() returns a Task representing a background
 operation that decodes a bitmap.
 
 The Task returned by Task::postToMainThread() does not do any
 background work.
