/**
 The traditional free filesystem expected by many apps is not fully supported
 on Web and there's not a lot of reason to polyfill it. A NoSQL database
 such as IndexedDB a much better fit, AFAICS, for most app storage requirements.
 Presumably this reasoning lies behind W3C's deprecation of FileSystem.
 
 Using IndexedDB effectively is tricky for Oaknut. Any C++ object is merely a
 collection of one or more byte ranges within the global heap buffer, there is no corresponding
 Javascript object and so the serialization that underpins IndexedDB cannot be
 directly used. So what we do instead (on web) is construct ad-hoc Javascript objects
 that encapsulate the Variants at the point they are read and written to IndexedDB.
 For this to work the Variant type must be convertible to and from
 a native Javascript type.

 And of course for non-web platforms we need a tiny file-based NoSQL implementation :-)
