# emBeeb (BBC Micro Emulator)

The BBC Micro was a popular UK home computer in the 1980s and many
British programmers began their careers with it. It was the creation
of Acorn Computers Ltd who later became ARM (Acorn Risc Machines) who
design the CPUs that power the vast majority of smartphones and tablets
today.

As is obvious from the UI this is intended as a mobile app and
it runs well in the mobile versions of Safari and Chrome. A native
Android build will soon be published on the Google Play Store,
however the iOS build cannot be published owing to App Store rules
concerning emulation.
